**Understanding Pet Adoption Behavior & Marketing with Google Ads**

1. **Theory: Factors Influencing Pet Adoption & Consumer Behavior**  
   - **Key Influencers**:  
     - Emotional connections, cost considerations, lifestyle fit, and perceived benefits of pet adoption.  
     - Generational nuances (e.g., Gen Y vs. Gen Z/Alpha) in motivation, search habits, and adoption criteria.  
   - **Relevant Frameworks**:  
     - Consumer decision-making models (e.g., AIDA, Consumer Journey Mapping) tailored for pet adoption contexts.  
     - Behavioral economics (e.g., choice overload, social proof from friends or influencers).
   - **Search Behavior & Keywords**:  
     - How potential adopters start their journey online (e.g., “rescue pets near me,” “adopt a cat,” “adopt a puppy,” “pet adoption services”).  
     - Common online paths (local shelter websites, rescue networks, social media groups) leading to in-person visits or adoption events.  
   - **Research & Resources for “AdBot”**:  
     - Insights on which keywords most effectively attract adopters.  
     - Best practices in Google Ads campaigns for shelters and rescue organizations.
     - Pet adoption decisions are influenced by several factors including the animal's appearance, breed, age, and compatibility with the adopter's lifestyle. For instance, appearance and perceived trainability play crucial roles in the decision-making process. Notably, the source of the pet (shelters vs. breeders) can also affect adoption choices due to perceived behavioral and health expectations. 


2. **Animal Personality & Adoption Decisions**  
   - **Influence on Adoption**:  
     - Personality traits (e.g., sociability, adaptability, temperament) often shape adopter preferences and satisfaction.  
     - Aligning the right pet personality with adopter lifestyle improves long-term adoption success.  
   - **Research for “CatBot”**:  
     - Dr. Kristyn Vitale’s work on feline behavior.  
     - “Mau Eyes” for cat cognition and emotional signals.  
     - Interact Animal Lab @ NU for broader animal-human interaction research.  
   - **Shelter Challenges**:  
     - Low adoption rates, high return rates, reluctance to foster, and seasonal trends (e.g., kitten or puppy season).
     - Varying preferences across generations, with younger generations (Gen Y and Gen Z/Alpha) possibly showing different priorities such as the pet's background or rescue status, potentially aligning with broader social values like animal welfare.


3. **Data: Identifying Necessary Information for Google Ads & Chatbot Development**  
   - **Google Ads Recommender Bot (“AdBot”)**:  
     - Historical Ads performance data (CTR, CPC, conversion rates).  
     - Shelter or rescue organization specifics (location, capacity, available animals).  
     - Keyword performance benchmarks (e.g., highest-performing phrases for adoption).  
   - **Adopter Onboarding & Customer Service (“CatBot”)**:  
     - FAQs from potential adopters (cost, care requirements, training).  
     - Real-time shelter data (number/type of available pets, medical records).  
     - Personality data for matching adopter preferences.  
   - **Publicly Available Datasets**:  
     - Kaggle datasets on pet adoption trends, local demographic data (e.g., pet ownership rates).  
     - Census data to understand household size, disposable income, and pet-friendly communities.  
   - **Existing Projects/References**:  
     - GitHub repositories on chatbot NLP, shelter data analytics, or prior Google Ads optimization scripts.
